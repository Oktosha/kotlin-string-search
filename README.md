# search for a string in a directory in Kotlin

The core is the function `searchForTextOccurrences` inside `src/main/kotlin/com/example/search`.

I wrote some tests for this function but the only thing tested automatically is that function compiles and doesn't crush. 
You have to look with your eyes that the search results are as expected.

To generate the big file, run the `generate.sh` script in the bigTestData folder.
